# Emissions of various greenhouse gases

# DO NOT ADD carbon-dioxide-equivalent conversion factors in this file!
# 'Global warming potential (GWP)' factors to convert to CO2-equivalents
# changed between IPCC reports and their values depend on the assumed timespan.

carbon_dioxide = [carbon_dioxide] = co2 = CO2

CO2_equivalent = co2 = CO2_eq = CO2eq = CO2e
# in the context of emissions, concentrations and resulting radiative forcing,
# carbon and carbon dioxide are usually treated as equivalent
# multiplied by the molecular weight of carbon dioxide relative to carbon
carbon = 44/12 * co2 = C
