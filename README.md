`definitions.txt` gives [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io)-compatible definitions of energy and energy-related units to supplement the SI and other units included in Pint's [default_en.txt](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/pint/default_en.txt).
These are used by:

- the [MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM](https://message.iiasa.ac.at) integrated assessment model (IAM),

and may be used for research in the fields of:

- integrated assessment,
- energy systems,
- transportation;
- or others.

Use `pytest test.py` to check that the definitions can be loaded.
Example unit expressions in `checks.csv` are also checked.
