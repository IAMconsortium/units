# Defined in https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/pint/default_en.txt:
# - tonne_of_oil_equivalent

tonne_of_coal_equivalent = 29.308 GJ = tce

# Fix for pint interpreting `kt` as knot [velocity] rather than kilo-ton
# (see https://github.com/IAMconsortium/units/issues/13

kt = 1e6 * kilogram

# Watt-annum
Wa = watt * year


# Orders of magnitude (short scale) to be used as prefix for other units
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude

hundred = 1e2
thousand = 1e3
million = 1e6
billion = 1e9
trillion = 1e12
quadrillion = 1e15


# Currency

# Based on Germany's GDP deflator, data from
# https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.DEFL.ZS?locations=DE

EUR_2005 = [currency] = EUR
EUR_2000 = 1.0564 * EUR_2005
EUR_2010 = 0.9463 * EUR_2005

# Exchange rate EUR/USD in 2005, data from
# https://data.oecd.org/conversion/exchange-rates.htm

USD_2005 = 0.8038 * EUR_2005 = USD

# United States' GDP deflator, data from
# https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.DEFL.ZS?locations=US

USD_2010 = USD_2005 * 83.426 / 91.718


# Transportation activity

vehicle = [vehicle] = v
passenger = [passenger] = p = pass
tonne_freight = [tonne_freight] = tfr = tonnef
vkm = vehicle * kilometer
pkm = passenger * kilometer
tkm = tonne_freight * kilometer
@alias vkm = vkt = v km
@alias pkm = pkt = p km
@alias tkm = tkt = t km
