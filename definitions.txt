tonne_of_coal_equivalent = 29.308 GJ = tce

# Watt-annum
Wa = watt * year


# Currency

# Based on Germany's GDP deflator, data from

EUR_2005 = [currency] = EUR
EUR_2000 = 1.0564 * EUR_2005
EUR_2010 = 0.9463 * EUR_2005

# Exchange rate EUR/USD in 2005, data from
# https://data.oecd.org/conversion/exchange-rates.htm

USD_2005 = 0.8038 * EUR_2005 = USD


# Transportation activity

vehicle = [vehicle] = v
passenger = [passenger] = p = pass
tonne_freight = [tonne_freight] = tfr = tonnef
vkm = vehicle * kilometer
pkm = passenger * kilometer
tkm = tonne_freight * kilometer
@alias vkm = vkt = v km
@alias pkm = pkt = p km
@alias tkm = tkt = t km


# Emissions of various greenhouse gases

# DO NOT ADD carbon-dioxide-equivalent conversion factors in this file!
# 'Global warming potential (GWP)' factors to convert to CO2-equivalents
# changed between IPCC reports and their values depend on the assumed timespan.

carbon_dioxide = [carbon_dioxide] = co2 = CO2

carbon_monoxide = [carbon_monoxide] = co = CO

methane = [methane] = ch4 = CH4

nitrous_oxide = [nitrous_oxide] = n2o = N2O

nitrogen_oxides = [nitrogen_oxides] = nox = NOx

ammonia = [ammonia] = nh3 = NH3

sulfur = [sulfur] = S
